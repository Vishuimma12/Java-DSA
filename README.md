Problem Statement: Briefly explain the problem youâ€™re solving or the topic youâ€™re covering. Include examples and constraints if applicable1.
Solution Code: Provide a Solution.java file containing your DSA implementation. You can organize your code into classes, methods, and functions as needed.
Sample Inputs: Create an Input.txt file with sample input data. This helps others understand how your code works and allows them to test it.
Expected Outputs: Include an Output.txt file with the expected outputs corresponding to the sample inputs. This helps verify correctness.
